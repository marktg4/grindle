# Grindle

My quick and dirty attempt at making an idle game. I wanted to figure out the most basic elements, and this can be a decent skeleton if I wanted to continue or make a different idle game in the future.

Idea is grinding XP and levels, like an rpg, or possibly more like an mmorpg. There are currently 3 skills, and as you level up each skill, you gain more xp in that skill. And as your total level increases, the speed of the game increases. This gives a good incentive for players to not focus only one skill, spreading their xp allows them to gain more lower xp cost skills, therefore increasing the game speed faster.
